<h2>Steps to prepare</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix the flour, salt, and oil.</li>
    <li>Add the chilled water slowly, mixing with your fingers as you pour.</li>
    <li>Do not knead the dough. It should be very soft.</li>
    <li>Cover the dough and let it sit at least fifteen minutes</li>
    <li>Take the dough and knead it for minutes. Divide the dough into twelve equal parts.</li>
    <li>Take one part of the dough and with your fingers flatten the edges to form a three-inch circle, leaving the center a little thicker than the edges.</li>
    <li>Mold the dough into a cup and place one teaspoon of the filling in the center.</li>
    <li>Pull the edges of the dough to wrap the dal filling.</li>
    <li>Proceed to make all twelve balls.</li>
    <li>Let the filled balls sit for three to four minutes before rolling.</li>
    <li>Set the filled balls on a surface with the seams facing up.</li>
    <li>Using the base of your palm, slowly flatten them into circles about three inches in diameter.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat frying pan should have about one inch of oil. To check if oil is ready put a little piece of dough in the oil. It should sizzle, and come up very slow.</li>
    <li>Fry them on medium-low heat. After they start to puff, slowly turn them over. Fry until golden-brown on both sides.</li>
    <li>If the kachoris are fried on high heat, they will get soft and will not be crispy.</li>
    <li>Kachoris can be stored for at least a week in an airtight container.</li>
